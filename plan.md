# Plan for the project

## Control flow

### Straight-line code - obvious dependencies, method parameters;

### When the order doesn't matter - group related statements together, reads like a newspaper

### Using { } with if's

### Most expected case first, unusual ones later

### Avoid comparing == true

### Else cases

### Positive if checks

### Numeric comparisons as operands

### Avoid deep nesting (2-3 levels)
